        <title>Marlene</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;a short haircut full of gray and hardship, maybe protruding just a tad over her ears. wrinkled, warm skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marlene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for the last three years, I’ve said hi to this woman every day when tapping in for my dining meals. for the last three years, I’ve tried to speak to her in broken Spanish with the remnants of my high school education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for the last three years, she’s replied in earnest. for the last three years, she’s always smiled and given me support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;last week, she hugged me for the very first time, stopping me just as I was about to exit the dining hall for the last time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she told me to enjoy my summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what’s that large structure clearly visible at the Ministry of Magic? oh, yeah, wizards and high-ranking members of society standing proudly over those of the lower classes, who are so tiredly holding them up with nothing but uncovered hands, which, on a surface level, might seem just fine, but, on a much deeper level, bear years of calluses buried in flesh and bone. you wonder why those higher members of society deserve to stomp on those below them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;are they truly below them? what’s magic add to a person’s intrinsic value? we’re all made in the image of God. maybe in JK Rowling’s world, that means nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see God in Marlene. from the way she tells me, &lt;em&gt;gracias a dios&lt;/em&gt;, to the way she so effortlessly treks through the tiresome journey that is a semester of the coming and going of hundreds of MIT students every night. some of us are dead from our work. some of us, frustrated at other things, take it out on her. some of us, unsure if we’re going to be okay, pretend to smile back at her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we’re all walking on the edge of a cliff, but she seems to be hovering in the air right by the cliff with us. she doesn’t break character. she smiles every day, despite whatever’s going on in her own life, the life-threatening surgeries she’s probably had to endure during those weeks when we missed her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in many ways, I see You, Lord. You are everywhere, from the janitors who smile at me when I thank them for their work to the biologists who aren’t afraid to reconcile their belief in You with the tangible logic given to them by training. You are not limited to class, to race, to profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are everywhere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>white noise // against the current</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a man today rowing against the current of the Charles. he was maybe a few dozen meters away from the rock on which I sat. he didn’t look unsettled at all by the heavy wind, by the waves hitting his boat with every passing second. his eyes were focused on the sunset in the distance, that ever-far sunset none of us can touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think he was even aware that he was going against the current.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and maybe that’s all of us. how do we know what direction we’re going in when we’re oblivious to so much around us? the cars passing by my window at night have become white noise after three years, but maybe I should be listening to them. what if the noises passing by periodically at night are some Morse code that’s God’s way of communicating with me in this world where people expect to see something tangible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. there’s a lot of white noise every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we, as humans, seek self-preservation, survival. if it means walking through the Infinite oblivious to the little details, the little marks in people’s demeanors and gaits—as long as we make it through our own difficulties, other things shouldn’t matter. except family, as per the implicit human desire to maintain those close to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it shouldn’t be that way. kind of like… I don’t know, but maybe a firehose is the right example. maybe I’m interpreting &lt;em&gt;drinking from the firehose&lt;/em&gt; too literally. maybe the ears, the nostrils, the microscopic pores on our bodies are sufficient conduits for drinking as well. it’s already a lot to deal with this literal firehose of work and stress and sadness and spontaneities, but maybe we can use the rest of us to take on even more. we can try to decode all this white noise and become more aware of what’s around us. perhaps that’d enlighten us as to what the hell is going on, if there even is anything going on. does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the lone girl standing by the Koch Cancer Institute, almost in tears, responding &lt;em&gt;I’m good&lt;/em&gt; unconvincingly when I ask her if she’s okay as I pass by on my bike. maybe she’s not okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the little bursts of joy that last milliseconds when I learn new things in biology. maybe they’re reminders of a life that could’ve been, that could still be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the way my friends look at me in the eye when I converse with them. maybe I’m engaging them, they’re piqued, and they trust me enough to listen to what I have to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the barber grimacing ever so slightly as his gray-haired client gossips with him about his company employees having sex behind his back. maybe the barber’s not having it today, and these lewd things don’t interest him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the sun coming out of the clouds and shining on you just as negative thoughts are filling your mind as you sit on Killian Court on a lazy afternoon. maybe God reminding you to look at the positives too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lots of white noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;are we meant to follow the current? I think the current might be harmony between us and the noise in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we’re going against it. we should go with it and listen to the sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lots of maybes here, but maybe lots of certainty as well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>full circle</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;last day of class, and a lot of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;why is Stata’s design centered around blue and tan? is that a complementary pair?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;why do I deserve a recitation instructor like Mark Stuart Day? &lt;em&gt;my usual example of overdoing it was my dissertation committee; it consisted of the scariest—Barbara Liskov, who went on to win the Turing award, and Butler Lampson, who also won the Turing award, and so on… it’s all good until the dream breaks and you don’t graduate. relatives and friends attending my graduation were sent to our child’s baptism instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;why do I care about people? how is it noticeable enough to the point that every one of the students in my recitations pointed it out when I asked for feedback? is that an unconscious thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think these questions have satisfying answers; they probe pretty deeply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also, things really came full circle. I passed on Mark’s decades-long experiential advice to my own students less than an hour later, as if I’d been in his shoes. they, in turn, may pass that on further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John approached me after recitation ended. wow, so Latter-day Saints have stricter, more conservative beliefs than us Catholics? wasn’t aware of that. or much else, for that matter. wonder if he’d corrected the woman who wrongly assumed that his work in quantum physics was enough justification for derailing religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;seems like everything integrates into a circle. not in the numerical sense—seems like all of life is a circle. the Lord comes and goes, the Lord comes and goes again. people are born, people die. classes diverge, classes converge. seasons come, seasons go. friends arrive, friends depart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is that generalization, or is it fact?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>biology revisited</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;being conducive to biology can be interpreted in a lot of ways. are you someone who just wants to study life sciences for a degree? maybe you’re someone who aspires to be a doctor, saving lives here and there. maybe you’re just someone who appreciates the complex, enigmatic nature of life itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;at one point, I was all three. an old-timer who used his high school stem cell research as an excuse to follow a biology/bioengineering degree. a firm believer in the importance of the world and the lives of everyone in it. a student who wanted to delve deeper, who could never get enough of the mysterious edge cases that defy textbook principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m no longer all three. after all, it took me 2.5 years before finally deciding to take my biology requirement here, something I’d meant to complete freshman spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;revisiting biology after four years, my emotions haven’t really changed. the fervor I had throughout the semester really does surprise me—always raising my hand in recitation, always asking about potential situations that could break a problem presented. the scientist rose once more. &lt;em&gt;if we assume that computer science isn’t a science.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there are only so many things one can do in life. classical guitar, videogames, novels, friends, food, relaxation, sleep, code, papers… the list goes on and on. where would life be had I stuck to biology?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ah, Lord, I suppose only you know.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>last staff meeting</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;the Jackson Room. a distant, fourth-floor meeting space in the deepest reaches of Building 38.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see the Excel spreadsheet before me, a mass of numbers upon numbers indiscernible to the naked eye unless observed diligently within several centimeters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see absences, recovered recitations, late arrivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I see special cases from Student Support Services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this time of the year can be rough for all of us. I’m blessed to have some time off this week, but I’m fully aware that this is probably a trough in my sinusoidal wave. MIT isn’t trivial, and this last staff meeting served as a brutal reminder of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;having never relied on Mental Health or Student Support Services these three years, I think I’m extremely blessed to have the fortitude and determination that I do. partly attributed to my nurture, mostly attributed to my nature. the fact that so many cases occur that we, as staff, have to deliberate for minutes for each student makes it clear that I’m not the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that I can be the norm. it’s wishful thinking. it’s foolish faith. but it’s a feeling that those like me share for the MIT community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nobody should have to jump. nobody should have to cry over numbers. nobody should have to worry about a condition that takes them out of the running for a presentation that yields 15% of their final grade that they absolutely cannot make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as both an objective staff member and an emotional human being, I’m at a crossroads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on to the next semester. on to more students. on to more grading.&lt;/p&gt;
