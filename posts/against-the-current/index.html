the cars passing by my window at night have become white noise after three years, but maybe I should be listening to them. what if the noises passing by periodically at night are some Morse code that’s God’s way of communicating with me in this world where people expect to see something tangible?<p>I don’t know. there’s a lot of white noise every day.<p>we, as humans, seek self-preservation, survival. if it means walking through the Infinite oblivious to the little details, the little marks in people’s demeanors and gaits—as long as we make it through our own difficulties, other things shouldn’t matter. except family, as per the implicit human desire to maintain those close to us.<p>it shouldn’t be that way. kind of like… I don’t know, but maybe a firehose is the right example. maybe I’m interpreting <em>drinking from the firehose</em> too literally. maybe the ears, the nostrils, the microscopic pores on our bodies are sufficient conduits for drinking as well. it’s already a lot to deal with this literal firehose of work and stress and sadness and spontaneities, but maybe we can use the rest of us to take on even more. we can try to decode all this white noise and become more aware of what’s around us. perhaps that’d enlighten us as to what the hell is going on, if there even is anything going on. does that make sense?<p>the lone girl standing by the Koch Cancer Institute, almost in tears, responding <em>I’m good</em> unconvincingly when I ask her if she’s okay as I pass by on my bike. maybe she’s not okay.<p>the little bursts of joy that last milliseconds when I learn new things in biology. maybe they’re reminders of a life that could’ve been, that could still be.<p>the way my friends look at me in the eye when I converse with them. maybe I’m engaging them, they’re piqued, and they trust me enough to listen to what I have to say.<p>the barber grimacing ever so slightly as his gray-haired client gossips with him about his company employees having sex behind his back. maybe the barber’s not having it today, and these lewd things don’t interest him.<p>the sun coming out of the clouds and shining on you just as negative thoughts are filling your mind as you sit on Killian Court on a lazy afternoon. maybe God reminding you to look at the positives too.<p>lots of white noise.<p>are we meant to follow the current? I think the current might be harmony between us and the noise in our lives.<p>we’re going against it. we should go with it and listen to the sounds.<p>lots of maybes here, but maybe lots of certainty as well.<div class="post-links"> <a class="link-to-post" href="/posts/marlene/"> <span class="link-to-post__next">&#10535; &nbsp;next post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">Marlene</span> </a> <a class="link-to-post" href="/posts/full-circle/"> <span class="link-to-post__prev">&#10535; &nbsp;previous post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">full circle</span> </a></div></div></article></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; Long Nguyen.</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
