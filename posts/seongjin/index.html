I couldn’t have been more wrong about her—she’s a complete angel. she was never out to get me, and I dare say I’m even developing the tiniest semblance of a crush. that’s obviously unfeasible, of course, so let’s get to the <em>meat</em> of this whole thing.<p>with some assistance from my roommate, 치호, I decided that I’d meet this woman again and see what she’d say.<p>I trusted her, and we entered this locked building, going up to the fourth floor alone together. the place seemed legit enough, but I was still ready to haul ass out of there at any moment. veins popping, blood rushing, eyes watching.<p>instead, she put on a beautiful 한복 and set up all this elaborate food for what was to be 효도, a ceremony for one’s ancestors—namely mine. she asked me for my personal information—birthday, parent’s birthdays, their names, when I’d return to the US—it suddenly felt strange again. I lied completely, but in hindsight, I wish I’d trusted her.<p>she wrote this info on several pieces of real parchment with various Chinese characters all over them. we knelt down and bowed at the altar, and as she burnt those pieces of parchment, she chanted something hauntingly beautiful, melodically. that ceremony was meant as a sendoff to my ancestors who had died unjustly and were still wandering this earth. again, not something I seriously believe in, but I appreciated the ceremony, and wish I’d told the truth.<p><em>it was all smooth sailing from there.</em><p>we’ve been meeting regularly since then, maybe twice or thrice a week, to talk about philosophy, life in South Korea, and the attitudes of modern urbanites.<p>the vocabulary through which she conducts our meetings is a <em>lot</em> to take in, but I’ve learned so much. 욕심, 불세상, 지옥, 천국, 현재, and so many others have flooded my mind. you see that prologue up there? that’s only a fraction of what we’ve talked about so far.<p>the next time we meet—this Thursday (7/27)—will involve Buddhist prayer. I’m not quite sure what that entails, but we’ll see.<p>this was one of my goals for the summer abroad: to immerse myself culturally and absorb as many different worldviews as I can possibly manage. it’s working out.<div class="post-links"> <a class="link-to-post" href="/posts/second-weekend-in-seoul/"> <span class="link-to-post__next">&#10535; &nbsp;next post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">이천도예, 신촌물총축제 // arts & water</span> </a> <a class="link-to-post" href="/posts/scam/"> <span class="link-to-post__prev">&#10535; &nbsp;previous post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">설마... // strangers</span> </a></div></div></article></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; Long Nguyen.</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
