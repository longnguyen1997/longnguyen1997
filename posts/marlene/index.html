You are everywhere, from the janitors who smile at me when I thank them for their work to the biologists who aren’t afraid to reconcile their belief in You with the tangible logic given to them by training. You are not limited to class, to race, to profession.<p><em>You are everywhere.</em><div class="post-links"> <a class="link-to-post" href="/posts/against-the-current/"> <span class="link-to-post__prev">&#10535; &nbsp;previous post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">white noise // against the current</span> </a></div></div></article></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; Long Nguyen.</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
