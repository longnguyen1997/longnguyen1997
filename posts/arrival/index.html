I got settled, unpacked, and that was pretty much that. the rest of the day involved an impulsive trip to E-Mart for basic living supplies <em>that clearly should have been furnished for us, but were not</em>, two rather painful mosquito bites after a respite of 7 years, and my inability to understand at least 50% of what was fed to my ears, 2 years of Korean class withstanding.<p><em>hello, Korea.</em><div class="post-links"> <a class="link-to-post" href="/posts/work/"> <span class="link-to-post__next">&#10535; &nbsp;next post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">work</span> </a></div></div></article></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; Long Nguyen.</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
