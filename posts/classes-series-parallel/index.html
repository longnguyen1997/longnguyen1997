I may not be as good at math as I thought, but I’ve certainly learned to navigate math.<p>now that I’m actually doing these things for myself, I’m so excited for what the future holds.<p>oh, and the freshman formal is tonight, along with a play production at 10PM.<p>today is a <em>beautiful</em> day.<div class="post-links"> <a class="link-to-post" href="/posts/3-days/"> <span class="link-to-post__next">&#10535; &nbsp;next post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">3 days</span> </a> <a class="link-to-post" href="/posts/winding-down/"> <span class="link-to-post__prev">&#10535; &nbsp;previous post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">winding down</span> </a></div></div></article></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; Long Nguyen.</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
