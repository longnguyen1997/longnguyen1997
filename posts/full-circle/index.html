I passed on Mark’s decades-long experiential advice to my own students less than an hour later, as if I’d been in his shoes. they, in turn, may pass that on further.<p>John approached me after recitation ended. wow, so Latter-day Saints have stricter, more conservative beliefs than us Catholics? wasn’t aware of that. or much else, for that matter. wonder if he’d corrected the woman who wrongly assumed that his work in quantum physics was enough justification for derailing religion.<p>seems like everything integrates into a circle. not in the numerical sense—seems like all of life is a circle. the Lord comes and goes, the Lord comes and goes again. people are born, people die. classes diverge, classes converge. seasons come, seasons go. friends arrive, friends depart.<p>is that generalization, or is it fact?<div class="post-links"> <a class="link-to-post" href="/posts/against-the-current/"> <span class="link-to-post__next">&#10535; &nbsp;next post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">white noise // against the current</span> </a> <a class="link-to-post" href="/posts/biology_revisited/"> <span class="link-to-post__prev">&#10535; &nbsp;previous post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">biology revisited</span> </a></div></div></article></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; Long Nguyen.</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
