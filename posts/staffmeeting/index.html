I’m blessed to have some time off this week, but I’m fully aware that this is probably a trough in my sinusoidal wave. MIT isn’t trivial, and this last staff meeting served as a brutal reminder of that.<p>having never relied on Mental Health or Student Support Services these three years, I think I’m extremely blessed to have the fortitude and determination that I do. partly attributed to my nurture, mostly attributed to my nature. the fact that so many cases occur that we, as staff, have to deliberate for minutes for each student makes it clear that I’m not the norm.<p>I hope that I can be the norm. it’s wishful thinking. it’s foolish faith. but it’s a feeling that those like me share for the MIT community.<p>nobody should have to jump. nobody should have to cry over numbers. nobody should have to worry about a condition that takes them out of the running for a presentation that yields 15% of their final grade that they absolutely cannot make.<p>as both an objective staff member and an emotional human being, I’m at a crossroads.<p>on to the next semester. on to more students. on to more grading.<div class="post-links"> <a class="link-to-post" href="/posts/biology_revisited/"> <span class="link-to-post__next">&#10535; &nbsp;next post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">biology revisited</span> </a> <a class="link-to-post" href="/posts/junioryear/"> <span class="link-to-post__prev">&#10535; &nbsp;previous post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">junior year</span> </a></div></div></article></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; Long Nguyen.</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
