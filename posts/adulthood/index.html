I suppose that takes away from the experience as well. there’s been no consistency in constant company since Yarim. nobody to call at an instant’s notice, nobody to share beautiful morning slumbers with. again, this is all probably just part of the phantom limb resulting from the breakup.<p>perhaps that will come again when I’m settled down with my future and my career and ready for a relationship. who knows when that will be—a year, three years, five years down the road? I imagine someone who’ll bask in my joys, cry in my sorrows, someone who’ll allow me to do the same for them. nothing else will matter—just maturity, love, understanding, benevolence, and respect. education won’t matter, height won’t matter, appearance won’t matter, among other things.<p>Minhtam is great, and we’ve shared our talks together, but as of now, we haven’t had a proper conversation in almost two weeks; she says she’s busy, but I know all too well that that’s an excuse.<p>I thought summer’s purpose was to clear up schedules and open up new paths, but how ironic is it that 3-hour Skype calls happened the week before finals and week-long blanks happen now? it probably won’t go anywhere, but I’m thankful for those talks that we did have.<p>maybe it was a mistake to fall in love at such a young age; being whole and independent is great, but I feel like I’m not living to the fullest. who and what would I be now had I chosen to shield myself from love, had I chosen to <em>grow for myself</em> to the fullest in academics and life within these next few years before thinking about love’s role in my life?<p>and besides love, there’s also the financial factor. hospital bills, W4s, tax witholding… I have to start taking care of those things now. I’m not just some provided-for teenager anymore.<p>adulthood is something else.<div class="post-links"> <a class="link-to-post" href="/posts/arrival/"> <span class="link-to-post__next">&#10535; &nbsp;next post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">도착했을 때 // first impressions</span> </a> <a class="link-to-post" href="/posts/punishment/"> <span class="link-to-post__prev">&#10535; &nbsp;previous post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">is this life's punishment?</span> </a></div></div></article></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; Long Nguyen.</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
