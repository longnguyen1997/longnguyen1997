I don't believe&nbsp;<em>anywhere&nbsp;</em>is boring if one just takes the opportunities lying around.<p>my first stop on the itinerary Saturday afternoon? 뿌리공원, a peaceful park located at the very bottom of 대전. I felt a sense of inner harmony, one I hadn't felt in so long, when I was there. perhaps it was the change of scenery&mdash;where in the United States do you find a park on the outskirts of the city, neighboring beautiful, domineering mountains and rivers? I think this description generalizes well to Asia. the beauty of our mountainscapes and rivers is unrivaled.<p>I managed to take a trip on the self-propelling duck boat. it felt great to go on the river by myself. facetimed mom, too.<p><em>I really hadn't felt that peaceful in such a long time</em>.<p>afterwards, I headed to 우암사적공원, a history park that was apparently the grounds for some famous Korean general or leader during the 조선 Dynasty. what do you know? the place was closed, and it was then that I realized that I irrevocably screwed myself over for the day by straying so far from 누리관. I was probably more than 7 miles away.<p>then again, does it really matter when amazing photo ops are involved? I got some amazing shots, and it's true&mdash;these pictures speak more than this b&amp;w text I'm typing now. afterwards, stopped by Lotte Mart and got 2.7L of various juices for&nbsp;<em>cheap</em>. there was also a 떢볶이 deal, 1,500KRW for one serving.&nbsp;<em>is it obvious that I ordered two servings? nothing beats&nbsp;떢볶이.</em><p>I returned home and got my first taste of the actual subway system. one word. amazing.<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sunday, 6/11</strong></span></h4><p style="text-align: left;">I slept in. did some quick shopping around the Golfzon area, trying to further understand the process of how markets work around here. I was dismayed at just how expensive Starbucks is in this country. a java bean frappucino costs nearly $3 more for the base size, and that's quite a leap. consumerism at its finest, eh?<p style="text-align: left;">yes, I gave in. I visited BHC, a popular chicken franchise in Korea that's been around since 2013. a waitress greeted me, and later asked for my contact information. I was surprised when she told me that she also wasn't Korean; I'm too used to having a native accent that when I hear others with one, I forget to consider that they might be foreigners as well. numberless, I gave her my Kakaotalk instead.<p style="text-align: left;">then church, the last milestone of the day. my first Korean mass! I understood little of the sermon, but some deduction skills led to this recap: he was talking about the Trinity and why for some people, it's so difficult to comprehend. something about grabbing on to the hand of the Lord, since we'll never know what the future has in store for us, whether that's an hour, a week, a year from now. powerful stuff.<p style="tep sxt-align: left;">I went home, and by that time, Chiho had returned. some TV, and sleep.<div class="post-links"> <a class="link-to-post" href="/posts/work/"> <span class="link-to-post__prev">&#10535; &nbsp;previous post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">work</span> </a></div></div></article></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; Long Nguyen.</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
