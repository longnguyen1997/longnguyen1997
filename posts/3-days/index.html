I’d never told her just how much my work was crushing me. I shrugged it off. one day more, and I come closer to seeing her. with that thought of love, I pulled through every single day, internally leashing my own complaints. to hear that she couldn’t be with me because of something I couldn’t control was devastating. did she ever realize how much I’d been hurting? I don’t know.<p>a leap in time here—second semester’s been a calm wave. going from a 61 on the Physics I final to an 84.5 on the Physics II final is pretty much self-explanatory. it’s indicative of just how much more I’ve been able to do this semester.<p>the wave is calm, and I’m still okay. life doesn’t stop its progression for anyone.<p>I’d like to be rid of these thoughts and memories, but perhaps they’ll never truly leave. you were my first. not just through that which I would now take back, but through everything else. I’d never spent hours alone with someone. I’d never looked into someone’s eyes and felt my world shake. I’d never placed someone so much above myself.<p>it’s a shame that we misunderstood each other. I’d always wanted to give you the world. my goal has always been to make you happy and to make you smile. I don’t know how many times I told you that, but I meant it. I wouldn’t remember it now if I didn’t mean it. none of it was a lie.<p>you wanted loving words and expressive actions from someone who functions and processes things 85% internally. sure, actions speak louder than words, but what of the things inside of me?<p>was not my love enough? even now, you don’t know how much I wandered the streets of Lower Manhattan, looking left and right for sunflowers that would take your mind off of your hard days. I saw orchids and roses and rejected them. I wanted to find the perfect sunflowers for you.<p>there’s so much that happened behind the scenes.<p>you don’t know how much I longed for you to see my attempts at action. I stepped away from my norm so that I could give you the actions you wanted.<p>and when I came to the Brooklyn Bridge on the Wednesday of that week, remembering our day by the shore. <em>she’s so beautiful</em>, I thought.<p>I wish you’d seen.<p>I don’t know who you are anymore. I haven’t seen you in four months. I don’t know what you’re doing right now. I don’t know if you’ll ever read this.<p>I only hope that the impending summer allows me to forget you as I so dearly want. I have a lot to look forward to with friends, family, and learning.<p>3 days left.<div class="post-links"> <a class="link-to-post" href="/posts/hello-vietnam/"> <span class="link-to-post__next">&#10535; &nbsp;next post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">good morning, Vietnam</span> </a> <a class="link-to-post" href="/posts/classes-series-parallel/"> <span class="link-to-post__prev">&#10535; &nbsp;previous post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">classes in series, ideas in parallel</span> </a></div></div></article></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; Long Nguyen.</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
