I never relied on anybody for happiness—never did I rely on anything other than myself, my passions, my friends, and my family for happiness.<p>I didn’t need anybody to tell me that I’m a special person. I didn’t need teachers to praise my work in school. I didn’t need a girl to “show me the world”.<p>could it just be first love? in high school, the times I believed I was in love turned out to be nothing more than delusional, whimsical times marked by conversations with as much depth as the shallowest bodies of water.<p>I didn’t talk about my vulnerabilities, least of all the darkest parts of myself. being able to share them with someone felt absolutely liberating. I realize now that in doing so, I moved away from my independence, removing and reshackling a once-leashed piece of my soul to another person.<p>I didn’t realize that in doing so, I had crossed a line from which I could never step back.<p>codependency is dangerous. it strips you of yourself even when you think you’re whole.<p>I am whole now. logic and intuition dictate it—mandate it, even.<p>no.<p>I am not whole. emotion and loneliness dictate it.<p>it’s all just one big clash. what I would just give to start with a clean slate, to be lobotomized and stripped of all I know.<p>she still haunt my thoughts.<p>what’s that line? “pain demands to be felt.”<p>how much does pain demand to be felt before pain abolishes its cruelty?<p>I’m just not the same person. I can go out with as many of my lovely friends as I can. I can play games on the PlayStation 4 for hours on end. I can study computer science and math with zealous passion.<p>I can do all that, and still I’d feel this hollow hole inside of me.<p>taking malevolent advantage of my shattered independence, this hole bore itself into me. I’ve been reduced from a rational, autonomous being to a confused, fragmented harddisk. which fragments of me are missing? I still go about my daily routine without as much as a drop of variance, but I feel those missing fragments calling out to me every day. are they even there, or are they just illusions conjured by the arcane thing that they call heartbreak?<p>am I whole, or am I a hole?<p>I’ve accepted that this probably will not go away, not until the day I repeat the cycle of codependency, when I choose to love someone new. next time, however, I’ll know more. perhaps I’ll never reach the stage at which I can claim myself “ready”—how can we ever be ready for something that’s so malleable, so conducive to sudden fluctuations in feeling and practicality? perhaps never, but I will know more.<p>love.<p>why do we love? it’s a social construct, yes, but as Anne Hathaway suggests in Interstellar, love somehow transcends notions of space and time. it’s not defined by anything we can empirically detect.<p>that’s a scary thing.<p>is this my punishment?<div class="post-links"> <a class="link-to-post" href="/posts/adulthood/"> <span class="link-to-post__next">&#10535; &nbsp;next post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">adulthood</span> </a> <a class="link-to-post" href="/posts/hello-vietnam/"> <span class="link-to-post__prev">&#10535; &nbsp;previous post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">good morning, Vietnam</span> </a></div></div></article></main>
